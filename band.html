<p2> My top 3 albums by Fall Out Boy are as followed:</p2>

<d1>
<strong><dt>Take This to Your Grave</dt></strong>
<dd> Take This to Your Grave is the debut studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy, released on May 6, 2003.
The band held a release party at Chicago venue The Metro. This album is my all time favorite because it introduced to me to the "punk" style of music at an early age and have been in love with it ever since

<strong><dt>Infinity On High</dt></strong>
<dd>Infinity on High is the third studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy, released on February 6, 2007. Critics say this album really helped Fall Out Boy's fame grow because they slowy 'drifted' away from their tradtional 'punk' style music to more of a 'pop punk' Fall Out Boy embarked on several tours to promote the album, including the Friends or Enemies Tour, the Honda Civic Tour, and the Young Wild Things Tour. This album is one of my top three because my all time favorite song "Thanks for The Memories" debuted on this album, along with several more of my favorite songs.

<strong><dt> Save Rock and Roll"</dt></strong>
<dd> Save Rock and Roll was released April 12, 2013. This album was released after a several year hiatus by the band. From 2009-2013 the band didn't release any new music or play any shows. So when this album was announced fans like myself were estatic. The album however isn't one of their best, however it will always hold a special place to me because it is what brought the band back together.
