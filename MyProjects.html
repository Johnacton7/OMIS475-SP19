        <br><br>In OMIS 324 Intoduction to Data Analytics we were required to find a data set and analze it. My group decided to do it on the "Google Play Store." We wanted to analyze wether it was worth using a free app or pay for an app for better features, and less advertisements. In the project we conducted several tests from regression analysis to see how the data related to eachother, and visuals to see the data visaully. This project also included a 15-20 minute presentation on the report through a powerpoint.

  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(132, 182, 230);"> <b>2016 Chicago Cubs Visual Analysis:</b>
     <br><br>In OMIS 473 Data Visualization we had to find a data set, write a report and create visuals on the data set in Tableu, and SaS visual analytics. This project was challenging because we had to find useful visuals for our data. Finding the right visual was challenging at times because we had to make sure the visual was accurate and looked good for the end user. This project gave me a much better understanfing for what a good visual looks like which I can use in my professional life.
