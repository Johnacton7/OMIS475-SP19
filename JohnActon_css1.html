<h1>Homework on a Snow Day</h1>

<p style="background-color:Green;color:White;">Doing homework on snowdays is tough. On one hand 
I just want to rekax and enjoy the day off. On the other hand 
I try to motivate myself and get some work done. One thing 
that works for me personally is doing homework in short segments. 
So I work on hw for an hour and take a 30 minute break and continue 
that process for as long as I can. Or if I'm really motivated I try 
and knock it all out in one sitting and finish it as soon as possible
 so I can enjoy the day. </p>
